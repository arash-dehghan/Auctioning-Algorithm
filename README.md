# Auctioning-Algorithm
The following is code impliments both the naive and sophisticated auctioning algorithm which is based on the MIT paper "Auction Algorithms" also included. The goal of this algorithm is to take a game theory approach (Thinking of something similar to the matching problem), attempting to find the optimal payoff matching for the agents, considering their values of objects, and the costs of the objects the agents are bidding on.
